"""
Rotate Matrix: 
    Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, 
    write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. 
    Can you do this in place?

Book Solution:
    The best way to do this would be to swap the nodes as we parse layer by layer.

Time Complexity: O(NÂ²)
Space Complexity:O(1)
